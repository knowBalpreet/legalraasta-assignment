	Steps:
		1. Read a CSV file, which consist of columns as names and row as Subject along with max marks eg Physics ~ 75, subsequent cells consist of marks.
		2. The CSV file needs to be read and uploaded to a directory using ajax only. Do not use form upload to a new page by page load here. Use ajax to upload the file. Store the data into database as you like it. Once the file is uploaded and data is submitted into database, you can redirect the user to a new page.
		3. After saving the database, on a new page fetch the data from database and display google chart of each case.
		4. I have attached few images with this project refer them on how to display the charts along with its menu.
		5. Note: At any given point of time only one chart should be displayed, for that I have created menu in two parts i.e Students Wise and Marks Wise with its subsequent content under it, so for example when you click on Sagar under Student Wise Menu, it shows, sagar's marks in all subjects but if you click on Physics unders Marks Wise, it should show 
		marks of all the students for physics subject.
		6. Use Google Bar Chart for from Google Chart Library.
		7. Do not change the CSV file format.
		8. For UI : use Bootstrap or Semantic
		9. Make the project look good with proper validation and secure file handling
